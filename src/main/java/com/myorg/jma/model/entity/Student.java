   * consider the behavior you want when dealing with related entities. In this case, since Student
   * and Club are separate entities and probably have their own lifecycle management, it might not
   * always make sense to cascade all operations.
   * <p>
   * CascadeType.MERGE: Applied to ensure that when you update the Student, the associated Club
   * relationships are properly merged (but not newly persisted).
   * <p>
   * CascadeType.REFRESH: Allows refreshing the Student or Club from the database if needed, along
   * with its associated entities.
   * <p>
   * Do not cascade REMOVE: Deleting a Student should not delete the associated Club.
   * <p>
   * Be cautious with PERSIST: This should only be used if both entities are being created together,
   * which is typically rare in ManyToMany relationships where the associated entities can already
   * exist independently.
